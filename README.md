# VGD_Final_Project   
C sharp model, unit 6:
string name = "Bob";
int messages = 3;
decimal temperature = 34.4m;

Console.Write("Hello, ");
Console.Write(name);
Console.Write("! You have ");
Console.Write(messages);
Console.Write(" messages in your inbox. The temperature is ");
Console.Write(temperature);
Console.Write(" celsius.");

In this class I leanred how to create my own images (background, characters, obstacles, etc.) and how you input them imto unity. I also worked in scratch and created my own code for obtaining power ups, how it affects the time, and how obstacles affect things. Using C sharp I learned how to code. Also I unintentionally learned perseverance and patience because every single time I was in this class something went wrong, I don't know what I did but someone absolutley put a hex on me.
